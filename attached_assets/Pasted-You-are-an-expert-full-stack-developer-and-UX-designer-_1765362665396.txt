You are an expert full-stack developer and UX designer.

Build a simple, fast, static website that recommends books for pilots based on the ICAO pilot competencies.

### Purpose
Pilots should be able to:
- Select which ICAO competency they want to improve.
- See a list of recommended books relevant to that competency.
- Read short explanations of how each book strengthens that skill in real airline flying.
- Click affiliate links for each book (placeholders are fine).

This is NOT a web app. No login, no backend, no database. Just a clean content site.

### Flexibility
You decide:
- the tech stack (any static-friendly stack is fine)
- page structure
- layout
- navigation
- component design
- how data is organised internally

Just ensure:
- It’s easy for me to add or edit books and competencies in one place (a JSON file, Markdown files, or any simple data system you choose).
- The site is mobile-friendly, lightweight, and SEO-friendly.
- Each competency automatically loads the books associated with it.

### ICAO Competencies
Use these eight as categories:
- Manual Flight Path Management
- Automated Flight Path Management
- Communication
- Application of Procedures
- Situation Awareness & Management
- Workload Management
- Problem Solving & Decision Making
- Leadership & Teamwork

Populate the site with a few example books under each category so I can see how the system works.

### Requirements
- Clean, professional design suitable for airline pilots.
- Smooth navigation.
- Clear typography and simple layout.
- Each book should display: title, author, summary, how it helps the competency, and placeholder links for Amazon/Booktopia/Audible.
- Include a basic About page.

### Deliverables
- A working static website.
- A data file or simple structure where I can add/edit books and competencies.
- A README telling me how to modify the data and run the site.

Focus on clarity, usability, and a structure that is easy to maintain. You choose the best implementation approach.
